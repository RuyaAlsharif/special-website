            <p class="pra">Think and Grow Rich is based on <em class="name"><a href="Napoleon.html">Napoleon Hill</a></em> earlier work The Law of Success, said to be the result of more than twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.
            <em class="name"><a href="Napoleon.html">Napoleon Hill</a></em> studied their habits and evolved 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich condenses them, providing the reader with 13 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".</p>
            <p class="pra">Mark Hansen has said time has shown that two of the laws/principles are most important:</p>

            <ol style="margin-left: 20px;"> 
               <li> The MasterMind principle/process and </li>
                <li> "Know very clearly where you want to go."</li></ol>
            <p class="pra">The book asserts that desire, faith and persistence can propel one to great heights if one can suppress negative thoughts and focus on long-term goals.</p>
            <p class="pra">The 13 "steps" listed in the book are:</p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Desire</li>
            <li>Faith</li>
            <li> Autosuggestion</li>
            <li> Specialized Knowledge</li>
            <li> Imagination</li>
            <li> Organized Planning</li>
            <li> Decision</li>  
            <li> Persistence</li>  
            <li> Power of the Master Mind</li>  
            <li> The Mystery of Sex Transmutation</li>
